It's not glamorous but I get to set my own hours so I'm home with my kid. I have a few great clients and I have some that can not be so great some times. Yesterday I was cleaning someone's bathroom and she very snarkily (is that even a word?) said ""Do you actually remove all that stuff,"" gesturing at all the bottles of shampoo and body wash. ""When you clean it?"" I told her I of course did and she was like ""Oh just making sure,"" and walks off. See I take a lot of pride in my work. I do my best to put back everything EXACTLY where I get it so the next time the client uses the shower everything is where they left it. For some reason just her accusatory tone kinda rubbed me the wrong way. I always leave her shower spotless and draining better since I always snake the drain. This time I wasn't so careful when I put stuff back and switched the order of things. Everything was back on the correct shelf but the shampoo would be switched with the conditioner. Yes this was petty and it wasn't my best moment, I try not to let those comments get to me. She's one of those people that spend too much time online and probably sees those stupid cleantok videos as well. 
",False,"You know, I clean houses for a living. Not the most glamorous job, but it lets me set my own hours. That way, I’m home with my little one, and that’s what matters most to me. I have some wonderful clients who appreciate my work, but then there are others who can be a bit, well, challenging. Just yesterday, I was cleaning a bathroom for one of those challenging clients. It started off normal enough until she walked in, looked around, and with a snarky tone said, ""Do you actually remove all that stuff?"" She gestured at the bottles of shampoo and body wash scattered around. I was taken aback. I mean, of course, I do! I pride myself on my work. I always put everything back exactly where it belongs so that when my clients step into their showers, they find everything just as they left it. But her tone? It rubbed me the wrong way. I could feel my pride stinging just a bit. I always leave her shower spotless and even make sure the drain flows better since I snake it each time. But this time, in a moment of weakness, I decided to let her snarky comment get to me. When I finished, I put everything back, but I switched the shampoo and conditioner. Yes, I know it was petty. It wasn’t my best moment, and I usually try to rise above that. But let’s be honest, she’s one of those people who probably spends too much time scrolling through those silly cleaning TikToks, judging the efforts of others. I shouldn’t let it bother me. I know my worth and the quality of my work. But sometimes, even the most dedicated among us can have a slip-up. So, I left her house, feeling a mix of satisfaction and a little guilt. I’ll keep doing my best, but a tiny part of me will always remember that moment. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll think twice before letting a comment get under my skin again.","Ever felt judged for your work? I clean houses, and one comment from a client made me rethink my pride.

I would have liked to think I'm a bigger person than this, but it seems it's not the case. Guess I'm in the right place to share my little confession! I (early 30s F) am marrying my fiance this week (early 30s M). He's the most wonderful and amazing person in the universe, but he's also extremely oblivious, socially awkward, probably on the autism spectrum. Boy just cannot pick a hint. He works with a relatively small group of people, and they get along great. They usually go for after-office drinks one Friday a month. Since we moved across the country a couple years ago, we haven't made a lot of new friends, so basically these coworkers are currently my fiance's closest group of friends. There's one girl in this group, let's call her Daisy (late 30s) who has an evident massive crush on my fiance. I must say, I don't blame her. My fiance is in tech and makes good money, wicked smart, tall, hot, nice, funny, interesting, and sweet. She has great taste in men! I've been part of a few of their get-togethers, and this woman acts like a teen girl with him. She giggles and literally twirls her hair, whenever she laughs she puts her hand on his arm (once even his knee!), always tries to sit right next to him, etc. When I pointed it out, he said he hadn't realized, then made a face like ""gross"" and said ""I'll make sure to sit away from her"". Before anyone does the Reddit thing: no, he's not cheating on me, or into her, or secretly encouraging it. We both work from home, we spend all day together, every day, I have full access to his phone, accounts, am friends with some of the other people who join those monthly after office drinks, they've never met without several other people joining, etc. My fiance is also extremely loyal, he doesn't do the typical things of following random women on ig, he's always talking about me, he's not a fuckboy, he doesn't like attention, doesn't like strangers touching him, I actually saw him lean away when she sat next to him, and straight up jerk away when she touched his knee. Additionally, he adores me. I even feel silly having to justify his loyalty, but I know how Reddit is. This man bakes me cookies and brushes my hair when I'm sad. He's a saint. Anyways! Our wedding is very soon. It'll be a small, intimate thing, only 35 people or so. We have a few gluten-intolerant guests, including Daisy, so we're doing cake for everyone, and special gluten-free cupcakes for these guests. We found a very nice boutique bakery that makes super tasty and safe gluten-free cupcakes. ""Literally the best in the province"", one of my gluten-intolerant friends said. One of our guests has proper celiac's, and she needs it to be like one-molecule-and-I-end-up-in-the-hospital levels of safe, so we're getting all cupcakes for our gluten-free guests there. This place, however, only has 2 cupcake flavors: chocolate or caramel. We asked each guest which flavor they'd prefer, and they all said chocolate, except for Daisy, who asked for caramel. **She doesn't like chocolate, and never eats it**. I know she's not allergic/intolerant, I checked and got a list of all her allergies when we confirmed her meal for our joint bachelor/bachelorette party. I was about to place the order, when I received a text. Long story short, I found out that **Daisy was planning on wearing white to the wedding, and her +1 friend (another girl) was gonna wear beige**. Of course, I went to tell my fiance, and he said ""what a fucking asshat"", and nipped that in the bud immediately. He straight up told them it was super rude, and that if they showed up wearing white/beige/cream/ivory/bone/super light pastels/very light gray/any other overly complicated way of saying ""white"", they would not be let in. Daisy complained that it was ""just a white blouse, I'll wear peach pants!"" and he told her ""no white at all, of any shade, anywhere. You're being rude to even consider it. The dress code is ""*wear whatever you want except white*"", you can show up in flip flops if you want. Why would you want to wear the one thing that's not allowed?"". She pouted, said her +1 was ""sad, because she only looks good in light beige, but alright"". He considered uninviting her, but I told him not to do it, or it could cause drama with the rest of the friend group, that we'll make sure the guard at the gate won't let her in if she's wearing anything too light, and my friends all volunteered to shower her in red wine if she dares. I'm also overall a very chill person, if she actually showed up in wearing white, I'd laugh my ass off, she'd be shaming herself in public. Anyways, I went back to placing the cupcake order... and just asked for all chocolate cupcakes. I guess it just slipped my mind to order a caramel one. Oops. Ah, well. Who doesn't love chocolate, anyway?",False,"I’m getting married in a few weeks, and it’s been a whirlwind of planning and excitement. My fiancé is the love of my life, but he’s a bit oblivious when it comes to social cues. He has this coworker, Daisy, who has a massive crush on him. I've seen her in action, and it’s like watching a scene from a rom-com—giggling, hair twirling, the whole nine yards. I'm not worried about my fiancé cheating; he’s loyal to a fault. But it's still uncomfortable. We invited his coworkers to our small, intimate wedding, and of course, Daisy was on the guest list. To accommodate our gluten-intolerant guests, we ordered special cupcakes from a boutique bakery. They only had two flavors: chocolate and caramel. Daisy, who doesn’t eat chocolate, requested a caramel cupcake. Then, I found out Daisy was planning to wear white to our wedding, with her plus-one in beige! I was shocked. My fiancé handled it, telling her it was inappropriate and that she wouldn't be allowed in if she wore white. She pouted but agreed to find another outfit. As I went to place the cupcake order, a mischievous thought crossed my mind. I ordered all chocolate cupcakes. Oops! I guess I forgot to order a caramel one. Oh well, who doesn’t love chocolate, right? Sometimes, a little petty revenge is just what you need to make a point without causing a scene.

She would even read confidential emails I would send her and management aloud to other people. Emails consisted of disputes I was having with other associates among other issues.

That is, until both of the backyard neighbors came to introduce themselves but really just spent 10 minutes telling me everything they hated about the water feature and the owners and other things on the property that I really did like, which at first I was agreeing with them but then got annoyed and said something like yeah I have a lot to do back here. So it turns out I *could* live with the backyard the way it was, for many years.  I finally got around to taking it all out during Covid, never did get a thank you.

I could only think about how they must have spent a small fortune on it. To me, it felt like a chaotic jungle rather than a peaceful retreat. I remember thinking, ‘I’ll rip this all out in the first year!’ But then, my neighbors decided to swing by. They introduced themselves with smiles, but it quickly turned into a rant.
